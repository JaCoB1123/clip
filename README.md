simple, non-intrusive Clipboard Manager

Since none of the clipboard managers I found served my needs, I started implementing my own. 

It's supposed to be:

- non-intrusive
- keyboard-accessible
- secure (not saving copied passwords to disk in clear-text)
- handling text well

What's going to be out-of-scope for now:

- handling images & more
- persisting clips
